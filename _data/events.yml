    This year we will hold a quick AGM in Shaftesbury Hall, followed by a fun quiz for all the family. 
    If you are able to bring a dish and a bottle of something to drink, that would be great, but everyone is welcome either way. 
    We very much look forward to seeing you there, finding out your views on what we should be doing and having a fun evening. 
    If you want to make a real difference to our area, this is your chance to join the committee too. 
    We are a friendly group and it has been a lot of fun being on the committee over the past few years.
