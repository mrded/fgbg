    Hello everyone - FGBG would like to invite you to our FGBG Egg Hunt.

    So come along with your family, find the eggs, complete the activity sheet and claim your eggs!

    To avoid disappointment we really do need to have some idea of numbers so please use the attached form to book your place and for further details. This is a family event and all children must be supervised by an adult.

    We are also having a litter pick prior to this event so if you can spare a little time to help with this we would be very grateful.  We look forward to seeing you!
