# Funding secured for the Rose Gardens

We are very pleased to announce that we have secured funding the restore the two rose gardens, absent for decades, to the raised flowerbeds on the west side of the green.

Work is underway to choose the varieties and colours, and we will need lots of volunteers to help prepare the beds, and plant them in the weeks to come. 

If you're interested in helping, please email: friendsofthegreenboundsgreen@gmail.com
