Despite the very wet weather we had around 100 people turn up for our first ever Easter Egg Hunt - it was exciting and inspiring to see so many local families come out for it.

Children had lots of fun walking around the green and filling out their activity sheets, and they especially enjoyed making Stick Men from natural materials.

Thanks to all who attended, and do check out our Events page for more gatherings throughout the year.
