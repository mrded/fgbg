Hello Everyone

This is just an update to let you know that FGBG are taking a litter picking break for the month of August.
We will, however, be back in earnest in September when we expect there will be a lot of tidying up to do after the summer.
<!--more-->
Our litter picks are usually on the first Saturday of each month so hopefully we can start again on Saturday 4th September.

Please keep an eye on your emails and our FB page for confirmation of this date.  

We are also really needing help with the Rose Garden maintenance and we have created a small what's app group of volunteers but the more volunteers we have the easier the work becomes.  The gardens looked beautiful this year but do require some work so if you are interested in being added to this group please let us know.  Alternatively you could join us on an ad hoc basis when we do our litter picking.

We hope you have a lovely summer whether you are away or staying put and we look forward to seeing you in September.

Stay safe!

Regards

FGBG Committee
