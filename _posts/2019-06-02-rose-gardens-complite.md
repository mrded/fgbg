The rose garden along the west side of the green had been neglected for years. 
It was decided to reinstate the garden to its former glory with help from Haringey Council, FGBG and volunteers who set to work planting in March 2019. 
The project was managed by FGBG committee members Moira, Angela, Emmy and myself. 
The official opening of the new rose garden took place on 2nd June 2019 and was well attended by Haringey Councillors, FGBG members and volunteers.
The beautiful roses are now thriving in their new home and are tended to regularly by volunteers.
