Ian Griffin and his lovely team at the Ranelagh have supported our work on the Green since we started in 2017.
They are now offering everyone who joins the litter picking and gardening mornings, 20% off food and drink on that day.

Make sure you ask for your voucher at the next litter pick. They will also be offering FGBG members 15% off food at other times.

Once you become a member, we will let you know how you can access this amazing deal and we will be sharing details with current members soon.
