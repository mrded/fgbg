Friends of the Green, Bounds Green (FGBG) want to know what you think about the proposed Bowes Primary Area Quieter Neighbourhoods plans.
<!--more-->

Enfield Council released a perception survey, but itâ€™s our understanding that a consultation will be done later on when the trial is up and running. We think that is too late so we want to hear your views now as big changes are coming. The measures are planned to be implemented in August and September.

We would be grateful if you could take part in our short survey; the results of which will be fed back to Enfield and Haringey Councils.
Please complete before midnight on 28th July 2020.

Thank you for taking the time to take part.
