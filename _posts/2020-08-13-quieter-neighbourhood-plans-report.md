Dear Members,

I hope you are all well and surviving the heat. As you probably know, we conducted a survey on the proposed Bowes Primary Area Quieter Neighbourhood plans and we have the results to share with you.
<!--more-->

Overview:
- 709 responses were collected
- Three-quarters (76%) of those who responded to the survey oppose the current plans with many feeling they will have a negative impact on their well-being through increased journey times and A406 only access, where many feel unsafe
- 13% are supporters of the current scheme and feel there will be many benefits to themselves and the wider community including lower traffic, cleaner air and safer streets
- 79% of those who responded are concerned that the plans will push traffic to other roads. 72% of those who responded feel concerned about increased journey times having a negative impact on the environment. 72% of those who responded feel concerned about having A406 only access
- 30% of those who responded feel a potential benefit of the plans is lower traffic. 27% of those who responded feel a potential benefit of the plans is cleaner air.  25% of those who responded feel a potential benefit of the plans is safer streets
- While supporters feel that the scheme will have a positive impact overall, some are still worried about their own access to the area and increased traffic elsewhere
- Both supporters and opposers feel that more could be done to make the plans work, for example allowing residents through the filters, re-introducing the right-hand turn at the end of Bounds Green Road and planting more trees in the area

Next steps:
- A number of committee members have requested that FGBG remain neutral on the LTN proposals and do not campaign one way or another
- Finding out the views of our members and users of our green space is central to our ethos though and reflected within our constitution, so in the absence of a prior consultation by Enfield to the proposed plans, we believe it is correct to share the findings of the report with Enfield and Haringey Councils and across the area
- FGBG need to do more analysis on the questions relating to the green and we will get back to you once that is complete
