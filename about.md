Friends of the Green Bounds Green (FGBG) was set up in 2017 by members of the local area committed to caring for and improving the local green space and strengthening the community. Monthly litter picking and maintenance are held on the third Saturday of the month, 10am to 12pm (excluding a break in August) as well as gardening sessions, and all sorts of community events. 

FGBG relies on volunteers and members for funding, so please check out the 'Become a Friend' page for a link to the form, or simply get in touch to see how you can get involved: friendsofthegreenboundsgreen@gmail.com
