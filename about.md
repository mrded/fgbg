Friends of the Green Bounds Green (FGBG) was set up in 2017 by members of the local area committed to caring for and improving the local green space and strengthening the community. Monthly litter picking and maintenance are held on the first Saturday of the month, 9:30am to 11:00pm as well as gardening sessions, and all sorts of community events. 

FGBG relies on volunteers and members for funding, so please check out the 'Become a Friend' page for a link to the form, or simply get in touch to see how you can get involved: friendsofthegreenboundsgreen@gmail.com
