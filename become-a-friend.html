<p>FGBG launched a new membership system in January 2021 via Member Mojo to improve data security and to minimise admin for the committee. If you are an existing member please be aware that we will be deleting our old membership list by 28/02/2021 to ensure we comply with GDPR. We will also be cancelling all annual PayPal subscriptions and asking our members to instead sign-up to our new system. There is the option to pay via cash or a cheque - if you state on the below form that you will do this, we will contact you separately to make arrangements. Also we realise many of you will have paid already, so again, please state that you will pay another way and we will check paypal and add a note manually this year to state that you have paid. From now on, membership payment will be annually and you will receive a reminder from Member Mojo. Please read our privacy statement for more information on how we will handle your personal data.</p>

<p>We realise the world is a tricky place right now and some of us may not be able to give as much as we once could. Whether you just want to join to support our work or you want to get actively involved, your support is hugely appreciated!</p>
