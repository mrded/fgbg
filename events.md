N.B. Litter Picking & Gardening is always 10.00 â€“ 12.00 except for the Christmas litter pick which is as listed and we do not run one in August.

We always meet on the Ranelagh side of the road by the con- crete circle near Tewkesbury Terrace for litter picking and gardening. Litter pickers, bin bags and refresh- ments will be provided. 

Please check [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofthegreenboundsgreen/) for regular updates and please wear suitable clothing and weather protection.
