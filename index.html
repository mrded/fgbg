<p>The play equipment on The Green was well loved by the local community.  The dilapidated equipment was taken away by Haringey Council in July 2023 and had not yet been replaced.</p>
<p>The Friends of The Green, Bounds Green (FGBG) is doing all it can to secure support from Haringey Council to replace the equipment.  The go ahead was finally given in June 2024 and the crowdfunding campaign has started (refer to PLAYSPACE).  The play space will enhance The Green as a local play space providing equipment that is close-by and encourages open-ended play.</p>
