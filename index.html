<p><strong>Friends of the Green Bounds Green (FGBG)</strong> was set up in 2017 by members of the local area committed to caring for and improving the local green space and strengthening the community.</p>

<p>Monthly litter picking and maintenance are held on the first Saturday of the month, 9am to 11am (excluding a break in August) as well as gardening sessions, and all sorts of community events.</p>

<p>FGBG relies on volunteers and members for funding, so please check out the <a href="/become-a-friend">Become a Friend</a> page for a link to the form, or simply get in touch to see how you can get involved.</p>
